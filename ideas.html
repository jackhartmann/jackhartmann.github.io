        <b>chess variant</b> with purpose of minimizing memorized openings while maintaining as close to standard chess as possible. Only moves one and three differ than that of the standard game as follows: 
      </div>

      <div class="idea-1-description"> 
        Black chooses White's first move; White chooses Black's first move. Move 2 is standard chess. For Move 3, the same procedure is followed as that of Move 1. Note that the board arrangement and all else remains the same. After Move 3, the game returns to standard chess for the remainder of the match. The basis of this variant could be evaluated to determine what number of altered moves would nerf openings while maintaining fair game. That is, perhaps the same procedure applied to Moves 1,3, and 5 would be the best or what have you.

    <b> fund (autonomous) space mining </b> in part from higher GDP countries obtaining equity in the form of an asteroid defense system. 
</div>
    
      <div class="idea-2-description">
This may be considered wishful thinking, but I'd argue the future we create should be based on "wishful thinking."
We live in a time, this century, where the cost of getting objects into Earth's orbit and beyond it is shrinking at a high rate. A large part of this is due to the recent privatized space race lead by SpaceX.  The tools to protect the planet from solar objects at a reasonable price is close to fruition.  </div>
<div class="idea-3-description">
  It does not at all seem like a longshot to think... Maybe, the company or group that first defends Earth from asteroids will also be the first to exploit them. This would be a largely autonomous system in both respects of defense and exploitation. For example, imagine two to three stations in the most advantageous orbits; this could be an orbit like the JWST or what have you. Each station is equipped with several detachable chemical rocket engines. The idea is, the rocket engines have some other means of propulsion that allow them to travel away from their home station to an asteroid. All these stages must do is arrive at the asteroid and land on it. These rocket engines would lodge themselves into the asteroid with one end and fire up their rocket engines on the other. 
</div>
<div class="idea-3-description">
  Clearly that procedure is easier said than done, but what are the alternatives? So, we have a few home stations with those detachable rocket engines. We would also need stations or a network of satelites whose sole purpose is to look out and identify these asteroids. With certainty, such a system already exists to some extent; however, it could be improved. For example, obtaining access to view the "blind spots" we currently have when looking out to identify asteroids. This leads me back to the funding problem. Who is going to fund this? High GDP governments should foot some of the bill for asteroid defense as its their citizens, their taxpayers, it protects.

<div class="idea-3-description">
  What about mining? Again, I think much of the technology will already be set. The only barrier is the cost getting us out of Earth's orbit. What can we learn from The Boring company's tunnel diggers? First, you would have to ask what type of asteroid is best to exploit. Obviously those deemed likely to have abundant rare earth metals, etc. But, what about size? Are smaller ones easier? Surely small asteroids have pros and cons as do large ones. For example, the cost of getting the material back to earth will be lesser from a small asteroid than large one. However on a large asteroid with a 'tunnel miner,' you may be able to accomplish two objectives in one effort. That is, mining and providing infrastructure in the form of tunnels on asteroids. Presumably, if assumming a circular asteroid, mining (tunneling) out a subterranian torus would grant stability. This will all have to be considered. For the time being we can imagine something like a Boring Company tunneler on an asteroid. This may not be the best way to mine, but it is fun to think about as it is "sort of" an existing technology. Can we autonomously bore and separate materials? This is where large asteroids may have some benefit in terms of stability to bore and space to set up an operation. What powers these mining operations? Solar? Not in the asteroid belt or past Mars. This leads you to imagine moving asteroids to orbits closer to our Sun so that Solar energy becomes a plausbable power source. Let's for now suppose that is not the case. We are mining beyond Mars on relatively dimmely lit asteroids. RTG's or full on power plants like that on a nuclear submarine seem to be the best option. Again, this is all [mostly] existing technology and the barrier is only the cost of getting us there. This barrier is rapidly depleting. I hope to live long enough to see humanity out there doing what I dream about today and with some luck I may join them.
