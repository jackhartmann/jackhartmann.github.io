        Tesla & GE are my primary ideas. Crypto idea should be taken with a grain of salt- only reason for posting was it's "validity" for so long. There is more to be added here. TradingView is a nice as you cannot delete ideas thus everything here can be confirmed and so can the success rate.
        <b>Update:</b> As of late April 2023, the GE trade is closed with returns on stock alone at over 100% in just over 6 months. Recall, this includes the shares obtained from the GE Healthcare spinoff. Contact me for my TradingView to see the idea there... I have since changed my TradingView from my real name to an alias as it is a site unhelped by having your name on the account (IMO).

        <b>#1:</b> Tesla's stock reversal during early Summer 2019 was easy to see coming. However, nearly every big bank and personality on CNBC was calling for its collapse and/or bankrupcy. I plan to upload media headlines from May/June 2019 corroborating my previous statement. Something seemed <i>off</i> about the mainstream coverage. While I did not disregard Tesla's depleting cash reserves at the time, the buying opportunity seemed to outweigh it:

        Due to the 15x stock split since the time of making this chart (May 2019)
      , it is of no use to "time-forward." In anycase, the bottom was correctly predicted. I'm not sure if what I outlined on the chart is even considered "Technical Analysis" as it is very basic. Still, the RSI on this timeframe was at near all time lows. The RSI alone here was a great signal of, at the very least, upward movement to come-- even if remaining in a downwards trend (ie, that since mid 2017). It's very important to note there was only three items pointed out in this chart: the RSI, the 2017 downwards trend, and the upwards trend dating back to 2013. It's my argument that all three, when taken together, <i>only</i> hinted towards upward movement of the stock price.  Lastly, one could assume at the time production costs were poised to decrease, supply chain roadblocks to be cleared, and Tesla was safely at the top of the EV market for the foreseeable future. This idea was at the top of the Tesla TradingView page for a couple months following its posting accumulating thousands of views.

        The mainstream coverage of Tesla was <i>off</i> during the early Summer of 2019. Continuing this topic more, check back soon.

        <b>#2:</b> Bitcoin luck? Chart from 8/19/2019 time-forwarded to today's date: 10/3/2022. This is published on my TradingView.

        The narrowing of the Bitcoin trading range was accurately predicted in August 2019. The roughly 50% price decline to the 6,000 USD area became a reality and Bitcoin did not close below the bottom line. I argue this idea is not luck up until October 2020. However, the trading channel that was outlined might have been relatively obvious. Now, Bitcoin seeming to find support on my line in June of 2022 could be argued as <i>lucky</i>.

        <b> #3: </b> SP 500 Outlook: Pretty simple as necessary. Complexity in technical analysis has led to it perhaps correctly being deemed junk science so to speak. After this chart was posted you can clearly see the SPX trading on the white line for a few weeks before breaking to the and bouncing from the bottom of the channel. A swift rebound was of course expected. The nice thing about simplicity in analysis is it is not unique. I'd argue most of Wall Street knew exactly where the SPX would bounce as marked here. Things become much more unpredictable when this channel is broken. Until then, it does seem that trading near the bottom of it is more likely than movement towards the top. This is of course due to the equilibrium of the channel being off kilter (my hot take).

        As always, you may contact me to obtain my TradingView. TradingView includes more of my original thoughts when posted (early 2023 in this case as you can see). Then I said the SPX would likely trade 'sideways' for Spring as we have now seen be true. End of Q2 may change the current sideways trend.

      <div class="tesla-update">
        <b> #4: </b> GE Idea (Now closed): It is a shame that the GE spinoff ruined the would-be asthetic of this idea (chart). To try and imagine what the chart would look like had that not happen simply take the first green candle to the left of the yellow line and move its bottom up to the lower white curve. Essentially, the most recent candle "should" be at the dotted white line. Both these lines indicate targets. Both targets were hit with the second being hit approximately 6 months after the ideas conception. Again, it does not look like the white dotted line has been reached but when taking into account the stock prior to the spinoff, it has been hit. This is more adequately addressed on my TradingView...

        It's important to note that the lines and curve drawn up on this idea look hand-wavy. There is theory to the madness (or apparent randomness) which I do not divulge to the public. Happy to talk about it with potential employers. Again I remind potential readers that ideas cannot be deleted on TradingView. Ask and I will give, and you will see the success rate of the ideas posted there.

        <b> #5: </b> One item more recent as of April 2023: I have posted an idea for the heavily pummeled stock that is Carnival Cruise Lines. The latter is a tight stop loss trade with high potential. That is, from the best of my knowledge you may risk relatively little for relatively high returns in the near term (less than one year). Target for $CCL is 13-15$ per share depending on timeline of its potential rise. Sustained trading below $8.50 is where it is a major 'turn off' for me.
