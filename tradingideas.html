      <b>May 18th, 2019: </b> "Tesla Bears Aren't Thinking" (Long $TSLA)

      <div class="format-notice">
      </div>
      <div class="format-notice"> On that day, I said Tesla would not go below $12 per share and for that reason, it was a safe buy at $13.33 per share. The stock was in the midst of a 24 month downwards trend, and I accurately predicted it's bottom to within one week. In the last couple years, Tesla stock's <i>lows</i> were nearly 1,000% above my buy price of $12 in May 2019. A vast majority of large banks were calling for its bankruptcy during this time, so my stance was very far from mainstream yet correct. Note, any request for confirmation will allow me to divulge the reasons that made it a "buy." The same is true for the remaining ideas.

      <b>August 17th, 2019: </b> "The "Simplest" BTC Chart " (Near-term short & long-term long $BTC)

      <div class="format-notice">
      </div>
      <div class="format-notice"> Bitcoin was trading above 10,000 USD on the date the idea was issued. Then, I claimed, Bitcoin would see a nearly 50% decrease in value in the coming six-eight months with a major breakout, to the upside, occurring the following year (2020). In fact, the chart for this idea remained <i>valid</i> until the SBF-FTX debacle that occurred in November, 2022.

      <b>October 3rd, 2019: </b> "Market Weakening" (Short US Market Indices for the upcoming year 2020) 

      <div class="format-notice">
      </div>
      <div class="format-notice"> When the Nasdaq Composite was listed at 7,872 on the day of posting, I claimed that it would collapse to the 200MA in early 2020 at 6800. There were two weeks in early 2020 where the Nasdaq Composite was listed at 6800, the correction level predicted months prior. I'm curious, 6 months before the Covid-19 market bottom and before any knowledge of the novel coronavirus, how many others called for a correction to levels that were hit in March of 2020?

      <b>October 15th, 2022: </b> "GE Could Beat Inflation" (Long $GE)

      <div class="format-notice">
      </div>
      <div class="format-notice">  On that date, General Electric was trading at a (spinoff-adjusted) price of $54 per share, I claimed it was a good buy with a target of 117$ per share. The target was hit in approximately 8 months.

      <b>February 10th, 2023: </b> "SPX 2023 Outlook" (Neutral)

      <div class="format-notice">
      </div>
      <div class="format-notice"> SPX's likely near term future (w/in 1 year) was outlined. In it, I made no concrete predictions, but identified the channel the market has been in since the early Covid 19 bottom. During the week of Monday, March 13th, the SPX touched the bottom of the channel I had outlined over a month prior. That week saw the highest volume in the equities market to "defend" the bottom of the channel that likely everyone with market influence knew existed. A breakdown of that channel would have been very bearish was unlikely during that time. Thus, this idea could have been utilized to generate profits.

      <b>April 13th, 2023: </b> "Easy 50% Return?" (Long $CCL)

      <div class="format-notice">
      </div>
      <div class="format-notice"> On April 13th, it was clear to me that Carnival Cruise Lines was preparing for a reversal. I claimed the trade would be voided if Carnival changed hands below $8.50 per share. That did not happen with the closest exchanged price being $8.76 on April 26th. The immediate near term target that I identified was $15 per share. 4-6 weeks after I made public my idea many banks came to agree. In fact, my trade was already yielding high profits when everyone else took notice. This idea was shared on applications employers during the time around its posting (before target reached). Most notably, ARK Investments LLC. 
      </div>
      <div class="format-notice">
      </div>
      <div class="format-notice"> 
       The media famed Carnival stock as "[$CCL] set to win the <i>triple crown</i> of biggest weekly, monthly and quarterly gain," as said by many in media during the end of June, 2023.
