        <b>#1:</b> Tesla's stock reversal during early Summer 2019 was easy to see coming. However, nearly every big bank and personality on CNBC was calling for its collapse and/or bankrupcy. I plan to upload media headlines from May/June 2019 corroborating my previous statement. Something seemed <i>off</i> about the mainstream coverage. While I did not disregard Tesla's depleting cash reserves at the time, the buying opportunity seemed to outweigh it:

        Due to the 15x stock split since the time of making this chart (May 2019)
      , it is of no use to "time-forward." In anycase, the bottom was correctly predicted. I'm not sure if what I outlined on the chart is even considered "Technical Analysis" as it is very basic. Still, the RSI on this timeframe was at near all time lows. The RSI alone here was a great signal of, at the very least, upward movement to come-- even if remaining in a downwards trend (ie, that since mid 2017). It's very important to note there was only three items pointed out in this chart: the RSI, the 2017 downwards trend, and the upwards trend dating back to 2013. It's my argument that all three, when taken together, <i>only</i> hinted towards upward movement of the stock price.  Lastly, one could assume at the time production costs were poised to decrease, supply chain roadblocks to be cleared, and Tesla was safely at the top of the EV market for the foreseeable future. This idea was at the top of the Tesla TradingView page for a couple months following its posting accumulating thousands of views.

        The narrowing of the Bitcoin trading range was accurately predicted in August 2019. The roughly 50% price decline to the 6,000 USD area became a reality and Bitcoin did not close below the bottom line. I argue this idea is not luck up until October 2020. However, the trading channel that was outlined might have been relatively obvious. Now, Bitcoin seeming to find support on my line in June of 2022 could be argued as <i>lucky</i>.
