      This section is more of a random journal of thoughts that happen to be present during the time writing or editing the webpage.

Timelines are fascinating and terrifying. Small things that occurred long ago affect us to this day. Tragic things occurred which no one can imagine wanting to happen, yet they are the sole reason you and I are here today. One of the few if not only takeaways from the strange aforementioned reality is the need for those alive today to not revive mistakes of the past. Many elegant, and often revolutionary-feeling, thoughts I have had in my life I later learned have already been said by someone long ago. Conscious life brings a few novelties into the universe. Most notably, love.

     We have seen an increase of "anti hate" movements. First, I commend the activists. Second, I find it very hard to be an active activist for such movements. Is this a personal flaw? Anti-hate is intrinsically obvious to me and for all people, things, and situations. I am not writing this to say "hey look at me," but to get to its potential source. My Mother had three things my sister and I could not say growing up: 'I hate,' 'stupid,' and 'shut up.' Is it that simple? Probably not, but I know that had a large impact on me. I've always thought that everyone knows something you don't or in other words, everyone has insight or something to teach to everyone else. In any case, I think the concept of 'hate,' is one on its path to extinction. Very optimistic.

     Question: What happens when technology is able to create completely new forms of life?  
     <div>I don't want to taint the readers own answering of this question, but I will say- this will one day be possible. Maybe not in my lifetime but relatively soon. </div>
